    <meta name="description" content="SHAWNE MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY'S this.Overflowing[1PENNY-FOR-YOUR-MEMORY_or_WHAT-IS-IT-TO-TIDY-UP-WHEN-YOU-GO].pkg (BREAK UP EDITION) is a sculpture inspired by the English idioms, "a penny for your thoughts" and "a drop in the bucket." What do we do with collected memories we can't come to terms with or say out loud? Where do we leave them? How do we let them live a life on their own? This work combines AR, JavaScript, and HTML leading viewers of the sculpture through a step by step process for participants to contribute their painful thoughts of ex lovers or past selves, leave them there, and let them live a new life within a poetry algorithm built into the work.
