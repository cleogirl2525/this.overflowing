    <meta name="description" content="SHAWNE MICHAELAIN HOLLOWAY'S this.Overflowing[1PENNY-FOR-YOUR-MEMORY_or_WHAT-IS-IT-TO-TIDY-UP-WHEN-YOU-GO].pkg (BREAK UP EDITION) is a sculpture inspired by the English idioms, "a penny for your thoughts" and "a drop in the bucket." What do we do with collected memories we can't come to terms with or say out loud? Where do we leave them? How do we let them live a life on their own? This work combines AR, JavaScript, and HTML leading viewers of the sculpture through a step by step process for participants to contribute their painful thoughts of ex lovers or past selves, leave them there, and let them live a new life within a poetry algorithm built into the work.

    <div id="div.lol"><span style="  text-transform: uppercase; color: #FFFFFF2b;"> 
        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
        (and i never forgot how you chewed with your mouth open.)
        Coral is far more red than her lips' red
        (but i tore my ACL on her sharp claws)
        If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
        (six white hairs poked out of my nose and fell onto her foot)
        If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
        (i can't sneeze, i couldn't and i wouldnt dream of it again)
        I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
        (and torn and stepped on and given up was i)
        But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
        (tumbling and drooling, that mirror was jagged)
        And in some perfumes is there more delight
        (when every sole of every one of her shoes squeeked)
        Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
        (stoneddddddddd, never to return)
        I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
        (nothing could be turned down like a spring nest)
        That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
        I grant I never saw a goddess go;
        ( i followed anyways)
        My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
        ( i followed anyways) xx
